"""What the product draws. Variant **F — Herdada · bloco**, locked in #12.

Thin frames, a 7-bit 50 x 5 ASCII banner, artifact names in cyan, the
description **indented under the name**, a blank line between categories and a
coloured block heading. The prototype that produced it is in the history of
`prototype/terminal-experience/`; what survived into the product is this file.

Every screen here is a **renderable**, never a print. That is what lets the test
doctrine record a screen instead of a byte stream: the snapshot is
`Console(record=True).export_text()` of exactly these objects, so an output path
that bypassed them would be an output path no snapshot can see.

Two positions of #36 change what the prototype drew, and both are subtractions:

- **the `list` does not show origin.** The `NOTICE` of the wheel is curation
  text the program never reads — it travels in the package metadata under
  PEP 639, which is exactly what keeps it off every screen and out of the
  target (ADR 0003);
- with the origin gone, its line held only the file count, so the count joins the
  size on the head line — *name, size and file count*, and the description whole
  underneath.

**Everything that comes off disk is rendered as `Text`, never as markup.** A
description is data: it is read from a `SKILL.md` this repository does not own,
so a `[bold]` inside it has to arrive on screen as those seven characters.
