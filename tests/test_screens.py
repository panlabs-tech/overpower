"""Structure at the gate, snapshot per screen — the test doctrine's §6, applied.

The two halves are on purpose. Measured in
https://github.com/panlabs-tech/overpower/issues/12: **colour does not break
tests and layout does** — changing the brand colour broke zero of nine tests,
because the snapshot froze layout and not colour. So the properties that carry
meaning are asserted structurally here, where an aesthetic tweak cannot move
them, and the bytes are recorded per screen, at 80 and 60 columns, without
colour.

**The catalog under test is the one that ships**, and that is the ticket's own
instruction: the truncation property is to be asserted *"com a descrição de 517
caracteres do pool como caso"*, and the pool skill of v0.1.0 was picked for
having exactly that description — the maximum measured across the promoted
skills (https://github.com/panlabs-tech/overpower/issues/45).

The consequence is deliberate and worth naming, because it will surprise
somebody: a **curation refresh moves the recorded screens**, since the sizes and
the file counts on them are the real ones. That is the snapshot doing its job —
the screen did change — and it is the opposite of the case doctrine §8 forbids,
which is asserting the *repository's content* instead of the code. Here the
subject is the screen; what is on it is data. The discovery tests next door
build their trees in `tmp_path` for exactly that reason.
